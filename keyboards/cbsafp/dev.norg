Rev Log

* (x) 01 --> 02
** (x) add macros for del on bspc and esc on enter
   - see qmk mods example... it should go in keymap.c

* (x) 02 --> hold 01
** (x) add macro to turn off all mods when I go to default layer
** (x) added caps word
** (x) added custom trackable caps lock macro
** (x) add home row mods to num layer
** (x) redefine pinky keys
** (x) figure out how to do ctl alt delete

* (x) hold -> 03
** (x) big keymap overhaul
*** (x) check out mouse movements for nav layer
*** (x) try to fit all symbols so they are no more then two presses away (layer
*** (x) shifted num layer button goes toggle else it goes one tap
**** (x) use one shot layer -> explained in one shot keys page
**** (x) use key override
**** (x) use custom key
**** (x) disable one shot layer in base layer macro
     - these did not work so I just did a one shot layer and enabled tap toggle

* ( ) 03 --> 04

* ( ) pending
** ( ) create full layer for navigation and common shortcuts
** ( ) replace number row with cool functions
** ( ) caps word on double shift
   - see how I like this
** ( ) check out key lock to toggle next key pressed
** (?) might need custom tap hold for keys that are not working
** (_) add alt mods for left and right versions of ctl and shift
   - would need smt for left and right alt as well
   - not needed now that I have home row mods
** (_) shif num to reach nav layer using macro custom key
** (_) ctl num layer goes to navigation
** (x) test one shot number layer button
   - could add shift + layer button to toggle instead of oneshot
   - maybe this would not be nice since it would make me have to think about what I want before I do it instead of just having the same motion every time... I can test both

* notes
  - seems like MT with plus and ampersand do not work
